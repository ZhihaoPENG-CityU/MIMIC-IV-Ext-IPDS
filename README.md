**Abstract**
<br>
In-patient diagnosis support is a medical specialty demanding clinical decision-making with real-time information, one of the most common hospital scenarios physicians face. However, a dearth of research has focused on developing general-purpose artificial intelligence tailored to realistic in-patient diagnosis support scenarios, despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) that have shown promise in various medical applications. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks are insufficient to simulate the complex conditions of patients encountered in a realistic in-patient diagnosis environment, highlighting the urgency and importance of our research. 
To fill this gap, we have developed an In-Patient Diagnosis Support (IPDS) benchmark derived from a publicly large deidentified database, comprising filtered and curated real-world demographic information, past medical history, routine examination, and radiology report necessary to arrive at the in-patient diagnosis of physicians, specifically the intern physicians. Specifically, the benchmark dataset includes 51,274 cases, 9 departments, 17 diseases, and 16 treatments, capable of interactively evaluating the information-gathering, consolidation, and diagnostic capabilities of LLMs. 
A significant aspect of our research is the collaboration with three expert physicians, where their participation in an IPDS subset-based structured question-answering text has been instrumental in fostering a comprehensive understanding of the compatibility between realistic clinical in-patient diagnosis scenarios and the IPDS benchmark. IPDS not only paves the way for a future of systematically investigating the performance and applicable scenarios of auxiliary medical LLMs but also offers hope for better navigation of the complexities of in-patient diagnosis.
